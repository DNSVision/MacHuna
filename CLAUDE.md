# MacHuna — Claude Code Instructions

MacHuna is a single-file Python app (`machuna.py`) that converts video/image files to Grass Valley Kahuna `.SWS` format. Built collaboratively by David Steer (DNS Vision) and Claude. David has no coding background — Claude writes all code.

## Dev environment

- Machine: MacBook Air M1
- Python: `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12`
- Build: `python3.12 -m PyInstaller MacHuna.spec -y`
- Run for testing: `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 machuna.py --gui`

## On every release (version bump)

When the version number in `machuna.py` changes, update ALL of the following — no exceptions:

1. **`machuna.py`** — `VERSION = "x.x.x"` near the top
2. **`CHANGELOG.md`** — add a new `## vX.X.X — YYYY-MM-DD` section describing what changed
3. **`DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md`** — update `**Current version:**` line and prepend a one-line summary to the version history in that line
4. **`HANDOVER_NOTES.md`** — update the `**MacHuna:**` line under `## Current Versions`
5. **`README.md`** — update if any user-facing features, supported formats, or workflow steps changed

Then build with PyInstaller and push to GitHub unless David says otherwise.

## Architecture notes

- Single file: `machuna.py` (~2,700+ lines). Contains conversion engine, SWS header builder, Watch Folder service, Batch Convert, SWS Preview Player, Hula SWS Extractor, audio handling, GUI, settings, and CLI.
- Version constant: `VERSION` near top of file — title bar reads from it.
- SWS format constants (`VIDEO_STANDARDS`, `FORMAT_VARIANTS`, `FORMAT_VARIANT_FPS`, `FORMAT_VARIANT_DISPLAY`) are all keyed by standard name string (e.g. `'1080i50'`).
- All ffmpeg calls go through `_run_ffmpeg()` so Stop/Cancel can kill them.
- Build output: `dist/MacHuna.app`

## Key constraints

- Do not add unverified video standards to the dropdown — they must be confirmed against real K-Watch reference files first.
- Field order for P→I transcoding is TFF (SMPTE standard for 1080i HD) — unconfirmed on 1080i hardware as of v1.5.19.
- PyInstaller builds must happen on the M1 MacBook Air.
